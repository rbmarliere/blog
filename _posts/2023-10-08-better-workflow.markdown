If you followed along my last [post][simple-workflow], you may have have found some
difficulties like I did. Namely, making sure the work is done without confusion. In this
post I want to share a few tips that helped me stay organized and effective, I hope its
helpful to some of you as well.

When I started investigating bugs I used to have a single *git* tree and then every time
I wanted to switch bugs or build a stable kernel it was *.config* hell, a complete mess.
I tried, then, maintaining different local repositories for different trees. But this is
a disk waste. Then I learned about the "*make O=*" trick to build the objects somewhere
else. It helped but I still had to checkout different commits and keep a tab of what I
was doing in my head. The solution was of course to use [git-worktree][git-worktree].
This is the process (all the variables in this post are illustrative):

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

# create your local work directory
LINUX_DIR="$HOME/linux"
mkdir $LINUX_DIR
cd $LINUX_DIR

# clone a bare repository
git clone --bare -o linus git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux.git

# add other relevant remotes to you
git remote add shuah git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shuah/linux-kselftest.git
git remote add staging git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git
git remote add stable git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
# (...)

# update all the remotes
git remote update
{% endhighlight %}

Now that you have a bare repository, you can add worktrees to split the different
things you might be doing into different directories. Here's an example:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

cd $LINUX_DIR/linux.git

# add a worktree to track the stable/linux-6.5.y branch
git worktree add --track --branch linux-6.5.y ../stable stable/linux-6.5.y

# add a worktree for a syzkaller bug
git worktree add --checkout ../845cd8e5c47f2a125683 69b41ac87e4a
{% endhighlight %}

This way, you can have different directories with different kernel *.config* files and
different *git* histories and patches you might be working on. In the example above,
[845cd8e5c47f2a125683][845cd8e5c47f2a125683] is a random bug I selected and [69b41ac87e4a][69b41ac87e4a]
is the commit ref. from the *2023/01/04 06:51* row of its crashes. You would proceed by
downloading its *.config* and other relevant files such as the reproducers. For that
it's best to have a directory only for these:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

BUGS_DIR="$HOME/syzkaller-bugs"
mkdir -p $BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683
cd $BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683

# download relevant files for the bug
# (you might wanna split those into timestamped directories,
#   e.g. $BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683/202301040651 )
wget "https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=KernelConfig&x=9babfdc3dd4772d0" -O .config
wget "https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=ReproC&x=142a1eaa480000" -O rep.c
wget "https://storage.googleapis.com/syzbot-assets/d4a7091814ba/bzImage-69b41ac8.xz"
unxz bzImage-69b41ac8.xz

# make your life easier with a link to the worktree
ln -s $LINUX_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683 linux

cp .config linux/
{% endhighlight %}

After the usual building process of the bzImage, its time to jump into a virtual machine
to test your changes. This can also be chaotic and inspired by this great [mentorship
session][tricks] done by Joel Fernandes, I wrote some [scripts][rq] to make my life
easier. The main tool is *rq*:

```
$ rq -h

usage: rq [-h] [-I IMG_DIR] [-k KERNEL] [--no-kernel] [-d DISK] [--no-disk]
          [-i INITRD] [-b BIOS] [-p PORT] [-f [F ...]] [-F [F ...]] [-c]
          [-a APPEND] [-g] [--wait-gdb] [--no-snapshot] [--debug]

Run qemu with sane defaults

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -I IMG_DIR, --img-dir IMG_DIR
                        directory containing images (e.g. initramfs, disk,
                        bios), can be set through RQ_IMGDIR environment variable
                        (default: /home/rbmarliere/images)
  -k KERNEL, --kernel KERNEL
                        kernel bootable image to use with -kernel (default:
                        linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage)
  --no-kernel           do not use -kernel (default: False)
  -d DISK, --disk DISK  disk image to use with -drive (default:
                        /home/rbmarliere/images/disk.img)
  --no-disk             do not use -drive (default: False)
  -i INITRD, --initrd INITRD
                        initrd image to use with -initrd (default: None)
  -b BIOS, --bios BIOS  bios image to use with -bios (default:
                        /home/rbmarliere/images/seabios.bin)
  -p PORT, --port PORT  host's port to forward into guest's ssh port using -net
                        (default: 10022)
  -f [F ...]            file(s) to copy into the disk (default: None)
  -F [F ...]            file(s) to copy into the cpio initrd (default: None)
  -c, --crash           append crashkernel= to cmdline (default: False)
  -a APPEND, --append APPEND
                        append kernel parameters (default: None)
  -g, --gdb             use -s (default: False)
  --wait-gdb            use -S if -s is used (default: False)
  --no-snapshot         do not use -snapshot (default: False)
  --debug               print qemu command instead of running it (default:
                        False)
```

This makes me able to do many things without having to worry about searching back my
shell history for the right *qemu* command. It's not perfect, but it helps. If you
noticed, the *--bios* parameter defaults to */home/rbmarliere/images/seabios.bin*, this
is because I'm using a custom built image with a [patch][seabios_patch] to
[SeaBIOS][seabios] that gets rid of the code that truncates long lines in the terminal,
so that I don't lose precious info from logs. This is what it calls on a default run
without parameters, inside a directory such as *$BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683*:

```
$ rq --debug

qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -m 8G \
    -smp 2,sockets=2,cores=1 \
    -net nic,model=e1000 \
    -net user,host=10.0.2.25,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22 \
    -enable-kvm \
    -nographic \
    -bios /home/rbmarliere/images/seabios.bin \
    -snapshot \
    -kernel linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage \
    -drive format=raw,file=/home/rbmarliere/images/disk.img
```

If you're feeling courageous and want to give it a try, install them with something like
this:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

GIT_DIR="$HOME/git"

git clone git@github.com:rbmarliere/rq.git $GIT_DIR/rq

cd $HOME/.local/bin
for file in $GIT_DIR/rq/*; do ln -s $file; done

# add ~/.local/bin to your $PATH, if you don't have it
echo export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
{% endhighlight %}

Some examples:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

export RQ_IMGDIR=~/images

# run a specific kernel after copying a reproducer into the disk
rq -k bzImage-69b41ac8 -f rep.c

# use an initramfs instead of a disk as the root filesystem
rq -i initramfs.cpio.gz -F rep.c --no-disk -a "root=/dev/ram"

# make permanent changes to the disk root filesystem
rq --no-snapshot

# debug the VM with gdb
rq -g --wait-gdb

{% endhighlight %}

## Kdump

Recently I was looking into a bug that is a concurrency problem. That means that,
although the reproducer provided can in fact reproduce the problem, it happens at random
times. That means you are probably gonna have to wait for a long time. So as much as the
*gdb* workflow presented in the [last post][simple-workflow] is very useful, for bugs
like this it can be quite painful. Using [Kdump][kdump-doc] and the [crash utility][crash] enabled me to inspect the system state at any time without having to depend on a running virtual machine.

I went through this [excellent presentation][postmortem] by Steven Rostedt and I must
say, it took me a while to grasp the process and setup everything. But its a very good
tool to have, sometimes. Hopefully I can help you save some time. The first thing you
need is to build a "crash" kernel. This is the kernel that it's going to replace the
system kernel after a panic. Here is what I did:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

cd $LINUX_DIR/linux.git

git worktree add --checkout ../crash v6.5.6
cd ../crash

make allnoconfig
# from `make help`:
# allnoconfig     - New config where all options are answered with no

make menuconfig
# TIP: when you search for a string using '/' character, the list provided
# have numbers attached to them, which you can use to quickly jump to its
# entry in the menu; you can also use '?' character for help.

# search and enable the following:

# 64BIT               64-bit kernel
# PCI                 support for PCI bus
# ATA                 support for ATA hard disk used in -disk parameter
# ATA_PIIX            ATA controller emulated by the default qemu x86_64 machine
# SERIAL_8250         support for serial ports
# SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE this enables the virtual machine console to be readable

# EXT4_FS             the filesystem used before, when creating the root fs
# BLK_DEV_SD          this makes /dev/sda visible

# NET                 we want networking inside the VM
# NETDEVICES          add support for networking devices
# E1000               driver for the -net nic,model=e1000 parameter

# INET                TCP/IP support
# UNIX                Unix sockets support, e.g. for /var/log/* and system utils
# PACKET              Packet protocol

# BINFMT_ELF          enables kernel to execute ELF files
# BINFMT_SCRIPT       enables kernel to execute '#!' scripts
# DEVTMPFS            create a /dev early on, to support early API filesystems
# DEVTMPFS_MOUNT      auto mount /dev
# TMPFS               support early API filesystems

# CRASH_DUMP          Kdump requirement
# RELOCATABLE         Kdump requirement

# CGROUPS             * (systemd requirement)
# INOTIFY_USER        * (systemd requirement)
# DEBUG_FS            *
# SECURITYFS          *
# CONFIGFS_FS         *
# BINFMT_MISC         *
# AUTOFS_FS           * (for proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.automount service)

make bzImage
{% endhighlight %}

This was the first time I configured a minimal kernel from zero and I learned a lot from
it. These are the symbols that need to be enabled to successfully boot the kernel after
a crash. Note that the ones marked with **\*** are dependencies for the root filesystem.
Systemd needs CGROUPS and INOTIFY_USER and the others come from the */etc/fstab* written
by the syzkaller's [create-image.sh][syzkaller-fstab] script that I used to create my
root filesystem (therefore, optional).

After this, you should install *kdump-tools* inside your VM:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

# you can use any kernel to boot the VM, e.g.
cd $BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683
rq --no-snapshot -k bzImage-69b41ac8

# after booting, inside the VM
apt install kdump-tools
vi /etc/default/kdump-tools
{% endhighlight %}

Edit the */etc/default/kdump-tools* file, inside the VM, accordingly (remember to use
*-\-no-snapshot* to make it permanent). Please refer to Debian's documentation on
kdump-tools in [/usr/share/doc/kdump-tools/README.Debian][kdump-deb-doc]. Here is mine:

```
USE_KDUMP=1
KDUMP_COREDIR="/var/crash"
SSH="rbmarliere@10.0.2.25"
SSH_KEY="/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
```

This way, whenever a crash happens, the *kdump-tools* will transfer the dump file into my
host's */var/crash/* directory. Before, I did the usual *ssh* authorization process of
creating a *ssh* key with [*ssh-keygen*][ssh-keygen] in the host, transferring the private
id_rsa into the VM and pasting the public key into the host's *~/.ssh/authorized_keys*.
Also, make sure */var/crash* is owned and writable by your user in the host, or change
*KDUMP_COREDIR* to something else.

Now we are only missing three things:

- Boot the system kernel with *crashkernel=* cmdline;
- Load the crash kernel into memory using *kexec*;
- Trigger the crash;

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

# make your life easier with a link to the crashkernel
cd $BUGS_DIR/
ln -s $LINUX_DIR/crash/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage crashkernel

# copy the crashkernel into the root filesystem next time you boot a VM
# -f copies the file into /root/ by default
# -c will append crashkernel=256M to the boot cmdline
cd $BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683
rq -c -f ../crashkernel

# after boot, inside the VM
kexec -p /root/crashkernel --append="console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda"

# trigger the crash with CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger

# ...or run a syz reproducer
gcc rep.c && ./a.out
{% endhighlight %}

Note the need for *root=/dev/sda* for the automatic handling of the crash dump taking
place. If all went well, you're gonna see the dump and the dmesg files under your host
*/var/crash* directory. But how to use it? Here enters the [crash utility][crash]. For
some reason that I didn't fully understand -- probably Debian related[^1] -- I was only able
to inspect the dump file using a locally built binary. Therefore, don't install the
[crash][crash-deb] package in your host.

--- *Note that you should have DEBUG_INFO enabled on the system kernel that crashed!*

## General tips

I use this as my */root/.bash_profile* inside the VM:

{% highlight bash %}
# fix the row/col height of the terminal
stty rows 71 cols 113

# auto build whatever rep.c copied into /root/ using `rq -f`
[ -f ~/rep.c ] && gcc ~/rep.c

# make your life easier with some aliases
alias a="./a.out"
alias s="./syz-execprog syz"
alias kex="kexec -p crashkernel --append='console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda'"
{% endhighlight %}

Also this *~/.ssh/config* in my host system to quickly *ssh* or *scp* into the VM:

```
Host syz
	Hostname localhost
	User root
	NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes
	IdentityFile ~/images/syzkaller.id_rsa
	Port 10022
```

In my host *~/.bashrc*, I use these:
{% highlight bash %}
LINUX_DIR=~/linux

# function to get maintainer for a patch from anywhere
get_maintainer() {
	if [ -z "$1" ]; then
		echo "usage: get_maintainer <patch> <opts>"
		return
	fi
	patch=$(realpath $1)
	shift 1
	if [[ -f scripts/get_maintainer.pl ]]; then
		scripts/get_maintainer.pl "$patch" $*
	else
		pushd $LINUX_DIR/linus > /dev/null  # assumes a 'linus' worktree there
		scripts/get_maintainer.pl "$patch" $*
		popd > /dev/null
	fi
}

# enables the use of `cd bugs` from anywhere
shopt -s cdable_vars
bugs=~/syzkaller-bugs

# a few useful aliases
alias cdL="cd $LINUX_DIR/linux/linux.git"
alias cdl="cd $LINUX_DIR/linux"
alias checkpatch="$LINUX_DIR/linus/scripts/checkpatch.pl"
alias db="gdb -tui -ex 'target remote :1234' -d linux"
alias make='make -j$(nproc)'
{% endhighlight %}

I hope I provided some inspiration to improve your workflow if you are a kernel hacker
wannabe like myself. If you have any question, comment, critic, suggestion or if you
spotted an error in here, please don't hesitate in reaching out to me at
[*ricardo@marliere.net*][email].


[^1]: As far as I can tell, *kdump-tools* is packaged with the clear use case of dumping a running Debian kernel and depends on the distro */boot/\** files
